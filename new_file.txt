Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And be one traveller long I stood,
And looked down as far as I could
Until it had bent into the under growth.

And then took the other as just as fair
As having perhap a better claim,
Becuase it was grassy and wanted wear
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.

I shall be telling this with a sigh,
somewhere ages and ages, hence --
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And I - I took the one less travelled by
And that has mad all the difference.
